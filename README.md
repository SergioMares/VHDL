# VHDL
vhdl codes that I made at my programmable devices class. Basic sintaxys of vhdl, secuential and combinatory circuits, syncronous and asyncronous, 3 bits processor, GLCD's driver and so on. Also it includes some jed files to simulate on a PAL with Proteus 8 and it's chip report to identify pins.
